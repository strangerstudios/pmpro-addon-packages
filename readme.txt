Contributors: strangerstudios
Tags: pmpro, paid memberships pro, ecommerce
Requires at least: 3.6
Tested up to: 4.6
Stable tag: .7.2

Allow PMPro members to purchase access to specific pages. This plugin is meant to be a temporary solution until support for multiple membership levels is added to PMPro.

== Description ==
You must have the latest version of Paid Memberships Pro installed (currently 1.8.5).

Story
* Admin designates a post as an "addon package".
* Sets a price for access to the post. (pmproap_price)
* Selects which membership levels can purchase the package. (pmproap_levels)
* For users without access, the page will show a link to purchase at the bottom of the page.
* Purchase goes to either a new checkout page or the PMPro checkout page with some parameters passed in.
* After checking out, they are taken to a new confirmation page or the PMPro confirmation page with extra info.
* After purchasing, the user ID is added to post meta (pmproap_users). The post ID is also added to user meta (pmproap_posts).

Limitations
* Only one time charges.
* No tax.
* No discount codes.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `pmpro-addon-packages` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory of your site.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. Edit a post or page to set a price for it.

== Using the Addon Packages Shortcode ==
The [pmpro_addon_packages] shortcode allows you to display a "shop" like page of available addon packages (all pages and posts with a defined pmproap_price). Add the shortcode to a page with your desired attributes. 

Shortcode attributes include:
* checkout_button: The text displayed on the button linking to checkout. (default: "Buy Now").
* exclude: A comma-separated list of the page IDs to exclude from display (default: none).
* include: Optionally set this attribute to only show subpages of the active page. Accepts: "subpages". (default: shows all pages and posts with an addon package price).
* layout: The layout of the output. (default: table). Accepts "div", "table", "2col", "3col", "4col" (column-type layouts will work with the Memberlite Theme or any theme based on the Foundation 5 grid system).
* link: Hyperlink the post/page title to the single view; accepts “true” or “false” (default: true).
* orderby: Accepts any orderby parameter as defined in the codex. (default: menu_order).
* order: Accepts ASC or DESC as defined in the codex. (default: ASC).
* thumbnail: Optionally hide or show the subpage’s featured image; accepts “thumbnail”, “medium”, “large” or “false”. (default: thumbnail).
* view_button: The text displayed on the button linking to view the single page. (default: "View Now").

If the user has already purchased the addon package, they will see a link to "View". If the user has a valid membership for the addon package, they can purchase without modifying their membership level. If the current user does not have a membership level or is not logged in, they can click the "buy" button to purchase membership and the addon package in one step.
